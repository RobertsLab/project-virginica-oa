## Eastern Oyster Ocean Acidification Experiment (ID: Virginica)

This is a collaboration between the Roberts Lab and Dr. Kathleen Lotterhos's lab at Northeastern University. Her team exposed twelve Eastern oysters, *Crassostrea virginica*, to two different pCO<sub>2</sub> for four weeks at 15ºC during the summer of 2017. Half of the oysters were exposed to 400 µatm (control), and the other half to 2800 µatm. The Lotterhos lab sent gonad samples for MBDSeq to identify if different pCO<sub>2</sub> conditions drive differential methylation patterns. [Yaamini Venkataraman](yaaminiv.github.io) prepared samples for bisulfite sequencing. This experiment will elucidate the potential for epigenetic inheritance, and provide background information for a Spring 2018 larval experiment.
