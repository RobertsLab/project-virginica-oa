- [2018-04-26-Gonad-Methylation-FastQC.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-virginica-oa/blob/master/notebooks/2018-04-26-Gonad-Methylation-FastQC.ipynb): Quality checks for *C. virginica* gonad MBDSeq samples. MultiQC was also used to compare FastQC results.
- [2018-04-27-Gonad-Methylation-Bismark.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-virginica-oa/blob/master/notebooks/2018-04-27-Gonad-Methylation-Bismark.ipynb): Pipeline for Bismark analyses. *C. virginica* genome was first prepared, then sample sequences were aligned to the genome. Bismark was also used for methylation extraction and summary report creation.
