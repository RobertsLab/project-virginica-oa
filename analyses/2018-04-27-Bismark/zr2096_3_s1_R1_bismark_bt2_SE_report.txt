Bismark report for: /Volumes/web/nightingales/C_virginica/zr2096_3_s1_R1.fastq.gz (version: v0.19.0)
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /Users/yaamini/Documents/project-virginica-oa/analyses/2018-04-27-Bismark/2018-04-27-Bismark-Inputs/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-1.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	10000
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	6272
Mapping efficiency:	62.7%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	1237
Sequences did not map uniquely:	2491
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	1401	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	1483	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	1666	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	1722	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
