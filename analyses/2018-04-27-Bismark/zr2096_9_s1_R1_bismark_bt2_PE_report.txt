Bismark report for: zr2096_9_s1_R1.fastq.gz and zr2096_9_s1_R2.fastq.gz (version: v0.19.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /Users/yaamini/Documents/project-virginica-oa/analyses/2018-04-27-Bismark/2018-04-27-Bismark-Inputs/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-1.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	10000
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	5195
Mapping efficiency:	52.0% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	3209
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	1596
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	1363	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	1229	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	1129	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	1474	((converted) bottom strand)
