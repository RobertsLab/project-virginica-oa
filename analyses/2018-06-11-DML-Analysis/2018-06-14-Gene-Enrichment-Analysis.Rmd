In this script, I'll use `topGo` to identify enriched genes for mRNA regions, exons, and introns that overlap with DMLs. I'm following instructions from [this manual](https://bioconductor.riken.jp/packages/3.3/bioc/vignettes/topGO/inst/doc/topGO.pdf) and [this blog entry](http://avrilomics.blogspot.com/2015/07/using-topgo-to-test-for-go-term.html).

Before I do any sort of gene enrichment analysis, I need to get Uniprot codes for all genes. To do this, I will use `blastx`.

### Make a Uniprot Database

The Uniprot database was downloaded from this link as a .fasta file: http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=&fil=reviewed%3Ayes&columns=id%2Centry%20name%2Creviewed%2Cprotein%20names%2Cgenes%2Corganism%2Clength%2Cgo(biological%20process)%2Cgo-id%2Ccomment(PATHWAY)%2Cdatabase(UniPathway)%2Cdatabase(CDD)%2Cdatabase(Pfam.

```{bash}
head uniprot-filtered-reviewed.fasta
```

```{bash}
/Users/Shared/Apps/ncbi-blast-2.2.29+/bin/makeblastdb -help #Get the help menu
```

The first step involves taking the uniprot fasta file and making a new database. To do this, I will use the following code:

1. Path to `makeblastdb` to create the database needed
2. `in` to select the input file for the database
3. `dbtype` specifies the type of file which in our case, is a protein file

```{bash}
/Users/Shared/Apps/ncbi-blast-2.2.29+/bin/makeblastdb \
-in uniprot-filtered-reviewed.fasta \
-dbtype 'prot'
```

```{bash}
/Users/Shared/Apps/ncbi-blast-2.2.29+/bin/blastx -help
```

Now I can perform a `blastx` to compare my query, the *C. virginica* genome, to our protein database.

1. Path to `blastx`
2. `-query` provides the file we want to blast
3.`-db` specifies database created in the previous step
4. `-outfmt` specifies the type of output file. I will use 6, a tabular file

I ran this section in the Terminal using the following code:
