These are gonad tissue samples from Kathleen Lotterhos at Northeastern University. Adult *Crassostrea virginica* oysters were reared at two separate pCO2 levels to see if this drove differential methylation in gonad tissue. 

- Sample ID: Used to identify *C. virginica*
- Date: Date gonad tissue was sampled
- Temp: Temperature at which oysters were reared
- pCO2: Two treatments (ambient: 400, high: 2800)
